            <h3>About Us</h3>
            <p>
              The family owned and operated business Islander Cruises has been
              operating for over 27 years on Lord Howe Island, Australia. Peter
              originally from Sydney spent his earlier years living on Norfolk
              Island before coming to Lord Howe in 1989 on a Scuba Diving
              holiday. He fell in love with the place and wanted to share the
              uniqueness and natural beauty of the island to its visitors and to
              offer all activities from the one place. Peter has been a Padi
              Divemaster for over 31 years and is the Owner /Skipper of M.V
              'Islander'. He has worked closely with numerous Marine biologists,
              researchers, and Scientists over the years acquiring an extensive
              knowledge of Lord Howe's Natural History.
