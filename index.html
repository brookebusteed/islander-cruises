          <h3>About Us</h3>
          <p>The family owned and operated business Islander Cruises has been operating for over 27 years on Lord Howe Island, Australia. Peter originally from Sydney spent his earlier years living on Norfolk Island before coming to Lord Howe in 1989 on a Scuba Diving holiday. He fell in love with the place and wanted to share the uniqueness and natural beauty of the island to its visitors and to offer all activities from the one place. Peter has been a Padi Divemaster for over 31 years and is the Owner /Skipper of M.V 'Islander'. He has worked closely with numerous Marine biologists, researchers, and Scientists over the years acquiring an extensive knowledge of  Lord Howe's Natural History.
